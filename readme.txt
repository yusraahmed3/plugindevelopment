Custom post types, custom taxonomies, custom fields and custom templates easily, directly from the WordPress dashboard without writing code.

== Description ==

"**Custom post types**" is the only completely **free WordPress plugin** that lets you:

* create custom post types;
* create custom taxonomies (eg: categories, tags, etc.);
* create custom fields;
* create custom templates;

directly from the WordPress dashboard without writing code or editing files manually in a few minutes.

The "**Custom post types**" plugin has been designed to make many advanced CMS features simple and accessible to everyone, without any technical knowledge or programming languages. Respecting the true nature of CMS (speed and ease of use).

This plugin is perfect for: **web agencies**, **freelance developers**, **WordPress fans** and anyone else!

The developer's ongoing work guarantees **maximum compatibility with themes** (compatible with 75% of the themes on the network), **plugins** and **page builders**. The plugin uses functions and resources already present in the WordPress core, this guarantees **maximum performance in terms of speed and security**. To report bugs, malfunctions, compatibility problems or send suggestions write to the [support section](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/custom-post-types/ "Plugin support").

Other similar plugins use many resources and external functions that affect the performance and security of the CMS. Why use external resources or custom functions if the WordPress core already includes everything you need?

"**Custom post types**" includes everything necessary for maximum customization of the CMS so as to adapt it to any type of project in a professional and extremely simple and fast way (ecommerce, hotel, restaurant, events, portfolio, community, etc.).
